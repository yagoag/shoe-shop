# ðŸ‘Ÿ Shoe Shop

Small shoe e-commerce website using HTML portals for creating a PWA-like experience of the routing.

### Enabling portals

As of now (June 2020), portals are only available on Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers such as Opera) under an experimental tag.

To enable it, navigate to `chrome://flags`, search for _Enable Portals_ and set it to _Enabled_. You will have to restart your browser for this change to take effect.
